const createSlice = require("@reduxjs/toolkit").createSlice;
// The slice takes care of defining action creator, switch statement in reducer  and handling immutable updates in reducer.

//Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

  numOfCakes: 20,

  reducers: {
    ordered: (state) => {
      state.numOfCakes--;
    },
    restocked: (state, action) => {
      state.numOfCakes += action.payload;
    },
  },
});
