// The slice takes care of defining action creator, switch statement in reducer  and handling immutable updates in reducer.

//Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.
